A library of MCMC methods, including
--------------------------------------
1. Metropolis-Hasting -> MH.py
2. Hamiltonian (Hybrid) Monte Carlo -> HMC.py
3. Adiabatic Monte Carlo -> AMC.py

Which ran on the list of distribution
--------------------------------------
1. Bimodal
2. Banana
2.


TODO:
0/ PRIORITY: List of distributions to be sampled from
1/ where to post research notes on mathematics behind MCMC?
2/ research code -> changeable kinetics and potentials
3/ PRIORITY: list of changeable parameters while running mcmc
